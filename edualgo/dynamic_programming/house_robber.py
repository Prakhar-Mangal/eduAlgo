                                House Robber Problem
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Purpose : There are n houses build in a line, each of which contains some value in it.
    A thief is going to steal the maximal value of these houses,
    but he canâ€™t steal in two adjacent houses because the owner of the stolen houses will
    tell his two neighbours left and right side. What is the maximum stolen value?

    Method : Dynamic Programming

    Time Complexity : O(n)
    Space Complexity : O(1)

    Hint :
    Apply Dynamic Programming on value array of houses to find maximum amount.

    Pseudocode: 
        house: array of houses which contain some values

        Initialize:
            val1 = house[0]
            val2 = house[1]

            Loop(i=2,size)
            (a) max_val = max(house[i]+val1, val2)
            (b) val1 = val2
            (b) val2 = max_val

            return max_val

    Visualization:
        Input: house = [2,1,1,3]
        
        val1 = house[0] = 2
        val2 = house[1] = 1
        
        for i=2,
        max_val = max(house[i]+val1, val2) = max(1+2,1) = 3
        val1 = val2 = 1
        val2 = max_val = 3

        for i=3,
        max_val = max(house[i]+val1, val2) = max(3+1,3) = 4
        val1 = val2 = 3
        val2 = max_val = 4

        FINAL RESULT = max_val = 4
